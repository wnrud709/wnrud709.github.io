<h1>Fluid Dynamics Simulation</h1>



<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>To simulate 2-D fluid dynamics of incompressible gases using Navier-Stokes equations. We will use GLSL fragment shaders.

<h2>Team Members</h2>
<p>JuKyung Choi, Hye Min Cho</p>

<h2> Problem Description</h2>
<p>
Solving this problem important because it provides us a way to render fluid motion which has been impossible to do only with our knowledge of meshes and raytracing. It would be our first time implementing a non-trivial shader. Brushing up on fluid physics would be another challenge for us.
</p>

<p> We plan to present a simulation of fluid propagating in another homogenous fluid.</p>
<p>
We hope to be able to take into account the different properties of fluid interacting and display different types of fluid propagating in an environment as a simulation. We will measure the quality by comparing the simulation to what we expect in the real world.
</p>

<h2>Schedule</h2>
<ul>
<li>Week 1: Figure out how to use opengl and how to apply Navier-Stokes to our problem. Set up a basic framework.</li>
<li>Week 2: Apply the physics equations and implement the simplest case of gas diffusion. </li>
<li>Week 3: Get a more complete simulation of gas behavior that incorporates a variety of factors like momentum, density, pressure, and stress.
</li>
<li> Week 4: Prepare demos and presentation. </li>
</ul>

                    The first time I listened to this piece, I thought, “What the heck am I listening to?” and turned it off. After listening to some of the other available pieces, I found myself listening to “Pillaging Music” again. The uniqueness of a percussion-dominated rhythm and the beating pulse of the music drew my interest more than pieces with distinct melody and harmonies. I can usually discern the emotional response a piece wishes to evoke from the listener like happiness, sadness, or anger, but the vibraphone from the “Pillaging Music” evoked some primal response that I could not describe in words. Perhaps that is exactly why the piece is named the way it is. Pillaging is very brutish and neanderthal, and is a result of people giving into their primal instincts of greed and lust that can be best represented by the percussion instrument reminiscent of the beating heart of wild men.

                        <h3 class="fa fa-4x fa-music sr-icons" style="font-size:30px">   Part I (0:00~3:00)</h3>
                        <p class="text-muted" style="text-indent:30px">The piece begins with four rhythmic notes that seems to set the pace of the music followed by a series of fast paced, higher-pitched percussion sounds. Muhly repeats this pattern of juxtaposing the controlled low-pitched sounds with a set of fast sounds that cover a range of higher pitches to create a sense of order and chaos. The lower notes reminded me of a group of people marching towards a destination. I found the flurry of higher notes alarming in contrast.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-muted" style="text-indent:30px">
                        What particularly stood out to me in the first part of the piece was Muhly’s use of the piano at 0:48. He uses the piano like a percussion instrument, playing chords in staccato to create a pulsing beat that progressively gets louder to build suspense. He mixes this in throughout the part amidst the percussion. Overall, the first three minutes of the song sounded like a group of people in a frenzied state in anticipation of the pillaging.
                        </p>
                </div>

                         <h3 class="fa fa-4x fa-music sr-icons" style="font-size:30px">   Part II (3:00~6:10)</h3>
                        <p class="text-muted" style="text-indent:30px">The second part of the piece takes an unexpected turn to calm and relaxing percussion and piano sounds. The buildup of suspense and intensity from the first part dissipates, as if to represent the calm before the storm. Muhly makes use of low piano notes and rapid iterations of single notes decreasing in intensity, gradually fading into silence followed by a pause of around three seconds. He repeats this pattern for three minutes, but it changes at every iteration in terms of the volume and the notes played. Overall, there is a gradual change from predominantly low to high piano and percussion notes. It felt like I was in some sort of trance and the sudden shift in the tone caught me offguard. </p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-lg-12 col-md-12">
                         <h3 class="fa fa-4x fa-music sr-icons" style="font-size:30px">   Part III (6:10~8:04)</h3>
                        <p class="text-muted" style="text-indent:30px">The final two minutes of the piece relies the most heavily on the piano and for the first time, the piano takes the forefront, supplying something close to a melody. The quick succession of piano notes is suspenseful and dramatic and the rapid beat of the accompanying percussion amplifies the mood. It is reminiscent of a scene from a movie where the main character is being chased down by the villain, barely escaping his outreached arms every few seconds. In the context of the pillaging theme, this would be the climax where the village is being raided and villagers are running in fear. The last minute of the piece returns to being percussion-based, but it is no longer the menacing repetitive succession of low notes. Instead, the percussion notes are higher-pitched and almost light-hearted. In the last thirty seconds, there are interjections of aggressive piano notes, which contrasts starkly with the percussion.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-muted" style="text-indent:30px">
                            These final two minutes deliver on the buildup from the previous two parts with strong piano and percussion melodies that arouse emotions of fear and alarm in the listener. I wondered why Muhly chose to include the minute of light-hearted percussion as opposed to ending the piece with the menacing percussion and piano section. Perhaps he wanted to paint an image of the aftermath of the pillaging. The contrast between the piano and the percussion could reflect the emotional turmoil of the pillagers as they try to shrug off their actions but cannot. A less optimistic interpretation could be that it shows the remorselessness of the pillagers as they walk away carefree with the piano representing the last remaining aggression they exhibit as they leave. Either way, I feel like the last minute offered closure to what felt like a long journey.

                    The first piece that popped into mind was Steve Reich’s "Different Trains" because of its unique use of dissonance. Like “Pillaging Music,” the first time you listen to the piece makes you question if you’re listening to music or a forceful amalgamation of dissonant notes. The repetition and the circular nature of the piece akin to “Pillaging Music” makes it feel like you’re on a journey. There is no real melody in both pieces. Unlike Reich, Muhly does not use voices to convey the theme, which leaves it more open to interpretation. Due to the distinct nature of the piece in its heavy use of percussion and distance from traditional melody, I couldn’t find another song with a strong similarity. If I had to choose another, it would be Schumann’s “Florestan” from Carnaval because of the use of repetition and the circular nature, and the dramatic shift in mood from fast and light notes to dark and heavy. "Pillaging Music" does not employ any particularly innovative musical techniques. Its uniqueness comes from the fact that Muhly manages to create a piece predominatly reliant on percussion. "Different Trains" was released in 2000, only five years prior to "Pillaging Music", so I would say this piece is unique in comparison to the classical works we have studied this semester.

                    <p style="text-indent:30px; text-align:left">”Pillaging Music” by Nico Muhly unravels a pillaging mission by relying on percussion as the primary instrument supplying “melody” and rhythm. The first third of the song builds suspense by starting out with light and playful percussion that gradually turns more menacing at the the end. The second part is a sudden shift in mood as the momentum built up by the first part is dissipated by the mellow sounds of the vibraphone. The third part is yet another shift in tone and the piano plays a large role in conveying the aggressive and menacing sounds of pillaging. Something that all three parts had in common was the use of crescendo and repetition to build up the unique theme of the individual part. The heavy use of repetition also made me feel as if I was a part of the band of pillagers, marching through the fields, getting to the village, and plundering goods. I felt exhausted by the end of the piece as if I was on the pillaging trip. I found the uniqueness of the listening experience in comparison to the pop music that we get so much of nowadays extremely refreshing.</p>

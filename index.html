<h1>Fluid Dynamics Simulation</h1>



<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>To simulate 2-D fluid dynamics of incompressible gases using Navier-Stokes equations. We will use GLSL fragment shaders.

<h2>Team Members</h2>
<p>JuKyung Choi, Hye Min Cho</p>

<h2> Problem Description</h2>
<p>
Solving this problem important because it provides us a way to render fluid motion which has been impossible to do only with our knowledge of meshes and raytracing. It would be our first time implementing a non-trivial shader. Brushing up on fluid physics would be another challenge for us.
</p>

<p> We plan to present a simulation of fluid propagating in another homogenous fluid.</p>
<p>
We hope to be able to take into account the different properties of fluid interacting and display different types of fluid propagating in an environment as a simulation. We will measure the quality by comparing the simulation to what we expect in the real world.

<h2>Schedule</h2>
<ul>
<li>Week 1: Figure out how to use opengl and how to apply Navier-Stokes to our problem. Set up a basic framework.</li>
<li>Week 2: Apply the physics equations and implement the simplest case of gas diffusion. </li>
<li>Week 3: Get a more complete simulation of gas behavior that incorporates a variety of factors like momentum, density, pressure, and stress.
</li>
<li> Week 4: Prepare demos and presentation. </li>
</ul>
